# Adaptive_axonal_delay
Adaptive Axonal Delay Training for Spiking Neural Networks

## **What is this repository for?**

Learnable axonal delay module with adaptive training scheduler to adjust the caps of axonal delays of each layer.

## **Usage**

Our delay module is based on [SLayer framework](https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch), after downloading the Slayer framework, 
you can easily implement our delay module and adaptive training scheduler.
